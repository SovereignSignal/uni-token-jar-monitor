Burn History Investigation (Dec 31, 2025):

Firepit Address: 0x0D5Cd355e2aBEB8fb1552F56c965B867346d6721
- Created 14 days ago
- ETH Balance: 0 ETH
- Token Transfers: "There are no matching entries"

This means the Firepit contract hasn't received any UNI tokens yet!
The fee switch was activated but no burns have been executed yet.

The TokenJar is accumulating fees but hasn't reached profitability threshold.
Current status: ~56% to profitability, needs ~$10K more value before burn is profitable.

The burn history showing "No burns recorded yet" is CORRECT.
No burns have happened because:
1. The fee switch was just activated 14 days ago
2. The jar hasn't accumulated enough value to make burning profitable
3. No one has triggered a burn yet

This is accurate - we should keep the "No burns recorded yet" message.
