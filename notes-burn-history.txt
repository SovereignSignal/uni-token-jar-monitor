Burn History Investigation (Jan 3, 2026):

UPDATE 2 (Jan 4, 2026): Fixed TypeScript compilation error that was preventing
burn history from working. The build was failing because log.args was typed as
Record<string, unknown> which doesn't have the 'value' property. Added proper
TypeScript types (TransferEventArgs, TransferLog) to fix the compilation.

UPDATE: Fixed bug in burnHistory.ts that was preventing burn events from being displayed.

Issues found and fixed:
1. The code was checking `if (!log.args.from)` which could filter out valid logs
   if viem didn't decode the 'from' field for some reason
2. Addresses weren't being normalized with getAddress() for reliable matching
3. TypeScript types for log.args were not properly defined, causing build failures

The 100M UNI treasury burn happened on Dec 28, 2025 and should now show up.
Additionally, any Firepit burns (4000 UNI each) should also be tracked.

Firepit Address: 0x0D5Cd355e2aBEB8fb1552F56c965B867346d6721
Burn Address: 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD

Reference: The uni-burn-bot (github.com/erin-koen/uni-burn-bot) tracks these same events.
