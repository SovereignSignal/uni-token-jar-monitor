Etherscan TokenJar Analysis (Dec 31, 2025):

TokenJar Address: 0xf38521f130fcCF29dB1961597bc5d2B60F995f85
Token Holdings: >$516.80 (>201 Tokens)

Key observation: We're only showing 41 tokens but Etherscan shows 201+ tokens.

The issue is that most tokens are UNI-V2 LP tokens (Uniswap V2 LP positions).
These are being transferred from Null: 0x000...000 (minting) to the TokenJar.

Recent transfers show:
- Remove Liquidity operations
- Match Token operations  
- All incoming to TokenJar from Null address (LP token mints)

The LP tokens are being correctly identified but not categorized properly.
Need to investigate why LP count shows 0 when there should be ~160+ LP tokens.
